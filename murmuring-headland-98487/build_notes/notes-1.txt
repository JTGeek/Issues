Front-End: 
Use Ajax, with exposed API key. Pull info from db, via app api.
    Pros: Quicker to write/deploy
    Cons: No security, API_Key is exposed

Back-End:
Create Endpoint for userID to send userID from local storage (client side).
Use ID to pull collection info from db, which can then be used to looped throught the CV api.
API Json results returned to client-side and used to append table.
    Pros: Secure, all keys, etc hidden in backend.
    Cons: More to write, longer to deploy, additonal possible breakdown points.
